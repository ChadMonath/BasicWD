    <h2>Kosmo</h2>
    <p>Here we have the North American Kosmo, known for his dopey smile, rockstar eyeliner and getting fur all over my clothes. This guy is a weird mix of Great Pyr, terrier,
        Australian cattle dog and some kind of lab. Kosmo is probably around 6 or 7 years old, but being a rescue who was found in an abandoned building, we have no way to be sure.
        He was in pretty rough shape when he was found, covered in mange and scarred up, but we've tried to give him a good life full of treats, soft things to lay on and some
        friends along the way. He's a huge fan of barking at stray cats and trying to strongarm you in to giving him some of your dinner. He's a good dog and a great companion. 
        10/10 Would adopt again.

    <h2>Sadie</h2>
    <P>This is Sadie Belle, Kosmos partner in crime. They have developed a strong bond over the last year and are rarely seen apart. Sadie, being a full blown golden retriever,
        is always up for anything. She needs to be the star of the show and will always assault you for scratches behind the ears and chin rubs. She absolutely adores chasing this 
        green laser pointer we have and will do so to the point of exhaustion. We've also incorporated a little Pavlovs Dog effect to this and it is triggered by The Price Is Right
        theme song. Once we start to play that song, she demands the laser pointer and is ready to go. We love her and she's been an outstanding addition to our household. 
        Another 10/10 score for this pup.
