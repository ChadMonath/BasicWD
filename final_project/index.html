            <p>Go to any pizza place in town, and you’ll find so-so pies made with so-so skills. Take one mouthwatering bite of our stuffed double-crust pie, and you’ll see why we’ve been the best pizza place in town since 1974! It takes six artisans to layer each pizza we make with the most flavorful ingredients. Our pies feature the fluffiest mozzarella — made exclusively for us on a small Wisconsin farm — and the ripest, reddest tomatoes, tenderly placed alongside the richest meats and vegetables. Discover our slow-baked pies and see for yourself why ours is the best pizza delivery and restaurant in town!</p>
