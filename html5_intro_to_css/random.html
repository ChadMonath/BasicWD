<h3>We're on to Arizona!</h3>
    <p>The Ravens improve their record to 5-2 while the Lions "fall" to 5-2. Baltimore looks to improve on this
        next week as they travel to Arizona to take on the Cardinals. The Cardinals will be without starter QB Kyler Murray
        as he continues to deal with injuries. The Cardinals have had a rough start this season and will be put to the test again
        against the Ravens. Kickoff is set at 4.25pm EST at Statefarm Stadium in Glendale, AZ.</p>
